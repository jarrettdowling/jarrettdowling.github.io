# Headphone Term Glossary

## A

- accuracy: The degree to which the output signal from a component or system is perceived as replicating the sonic qualities of its input signal. An accurate device reproduces what is on the recording, which may or may not be an accurate representation of the original sound.

- acoustical space:
    1) A large performing or recording hall. 
    2) All the spatial and reverberant characteristics of the performing hall or location in which a recording was made.

- acuity:
    1) The sensitivity of the ears to very soft sounds. 
    2) The acquired ability of an audiophile to hear and to assess the subtle qualitative attributes of reproduced sound.

- aggressive Reproduced sound that is excessively forward and bright.

- "ah" (rhymes with "rah"): A vowel coloration caused by a frequency-response peak centered around 1000Hz.

- airy: Pertaining to treble which sounds light, delicate, open, and seemingly unrestricted in upper extension. A quality of reproducing systems having very smooth and very extended HF response.

- aliveness: A quality of sound reproduction which gives an impression that the performers are present, in person, in the listening room.

- ambiance (pronounced "ambee-onts"): The feeling or mood evoked by an environment.

- ambience (pronounced "ambee-ints"): The aurally perceived impression of an acoustical space, such as the performing hall in which a recording was made.

- analytical: Very detailed, almost to the point of excess.

- articulation:
    1) Clarity and intelligibility, usually of voice reproduction. 
    2) The reproduction of inner detail in complex sounds, which makes it easy to follow an individual musical voice among many.

- attack:
    1) The buildup of sound when an instrument is bowed, blown, struck, or plucked. 
    2) The ability of a system to reproduce the attack transients in musical sound. Poor attack makes a system sound slow.

- attack transient: The initial energy pulse of a percussive sound, such as from a piano string, triangle, or drum head.

- audibility: The measure of the severity of a sonic imperfection. The scale of audibility, from least audible to most audible, is: inaudible, subtle, slight, moderate, obvious, conspicuous, and Arrggh!!

- auronihilist (pronounced "auro-nigh-illist"): A person who believes that all components that measure the same, sound the same. A meter man.

- autohype: Suggestive self-deception; hearing something that isn't there, because you expect it to be. A rich source of audio mythology.

- "aw" (rhymes with "paw"): A vowel coloration caused by a frequency-response peak centered around 450Hz. An "aw" coloration tends to emphasize and glamorize the sound of large brass instruments (trombone, tuba).

## B

- balance:
    1) The subjective relationship between the relative loudness of the upper and lower halves of the audio spectrum; "tonal balance." 
    2) The relative loudness of the instruments in a performing group. 3) Equality of signal level between the left and right stereo channels, which centers the soundstage and allows mono program material to image at the center. Also called channel balance.

- billowing, billowy: Excessively reverberant.

- binaural: Literally hearing with "two ears," refers to a recording/playback system which presents the listener's ears with the acoustic waveforms they would have received at the original event. Only currently achievable with a "dummy-head" microphone and playback via headphones.

- bloated:
    1) When describing a phantom image: excessively wide. 
    2) When describing sound in general: overly rich, warm, and reverberant.

- bloom: A quality of expansive richness and warmth, like the live body sound of a cello.

- body: A quality of roundness and robustness in reproduced sound. "Gutsiness."

- boxy:
    1) Characterized by an "oh" vowel coloration, as when speaking with one's head inside a box. 
    2) Used to describe the upper-bass/lower-midrange sound of a loudspeaker with excessive cabinet-wall resonances.

- breakup: The sound of severe analog-disc mistracking.

- breathing: From a dynamic noise-reduction system: audible changes in the level of background hiss in accordance with changes in signal volume. See "pumping."

- bright, brilliant: The most often misused terms in audio, these describe the degree to which reproduced sound has a hard, crisp edge to it. Brightness relates to the energy content in the 4kHz-8kHz band. It is not related to output in the extreme-high-frequency range. All live sound has brightness; it is a problem only when it is excessive.

- bunching:
    1) In double-mono repro~duction, the imaging of all sounds from a small area between the loudspeakers. Tight (narrow) bunching in A+B mode is essential for good imaging specificity in stereo. 
    2) In stereo reproduction, excessive center fill with inadequate spread. Compare with stereo spread.

- chesty: A pronounced thickness or heaviness from reproduced male voice, due to excessive energy in the upper bass or lower midrange.

- chocolatey: Like "syrupy," but darker and more full-bodied.

- circularity: The paradox of subjectivity: "You can't judge a recording without reproducing it, and you can't judge a reproducer without listening to a recording."

- clean: Free from audible distortion.

- click: A small, sharp impulse that sounds like the word "click."

- clinical: Sound that is pristinely clean but wholly uninvolving.

- closed-in: Lacking in openness, delicacy, air, and fine detail. A closed-in sound is usually caused by HF rolloff above 10kHz. Compare with "open," "airy."

- cocktail-party effect: The auditory system's controllable ability to separate-out, on the basis of direction alone, one sound source from many coming from different directions. It allows you to follow one voice among the others at a noisy cocktail party.

- cognitive dissonance: A conflict between observations, as when a sound has the timbre of a close listening seat but the perspective of a distant one.

- coherent:
    1) Pertaining to a multi-way loudspeaker's sound: seamless from top to bottom; showing no audible evidence of a crossover or of different driver colorations in different frequency ranges. 
    2) Pertaining to the soundstage: Phantom imaging that reproduces within the stereo stage the original lateral positions of the performers. See "bunching," "hole-in-the-middle."

- cold: The same as "cool," only more so. Having somewhat excessive upper-range output and weak lower-range output.

- coloration: An audible "signature" with which a reproducing system imbues all signals passing through it.

- comb filtering: A hollow coloration that, once recognized, is unmistakable. Caused by a regularly spaced series of frequency-response peaks and dips, most often due to interference between two identical signals spaced in time. If that time difference is continually changed, the comb-filter peaks and dips move accordingly, giving rise to the familiar "phasing," "flanging," or "jet plane" effect used in modern rock music.

- congested: Smeared, confused, muddy, and flat. Totally devoid of transparency.

- consonant: Agreeable to the ear; pleasant-sounding. Compare "dissonant."

- conspicuous: Very audible. See "audibility."

- continuity:
    1) Of the soundstage: the reproduction of the original lateral positions of the stereo images. See "bunching," "hole-in-the-middle," "stereo spread." 
    2) Of a multi-way loudspeaker: uniformity of coloration from the operating range of one driver to that of the other(s).

- control: The extent to which a loudspeaker sounds as if it is "tracking" the signal being fed to it. The sound is tight, detailed, and focused. See "damping."

- cool: Moderately deficient in body and warmth, due to progressive attenuation of frequencies below about 150Hz.

- direct sound: A sound reaching the ears in a straight line from its source. The direct sounds are always the first sounds heard. The "critical distance" from a soundsource is when the spl of the direct sound is equal to that of the reverberant field. See "far field," "near field," "precedence effect." Compare "reflected sound," "reverberation."

- discontinuity: A change of timbre or coloration due to the signal's transition, in a multi-way speaker system, from one driver to another having dissimilar coloration.

- dished, dished-down: Describes a frequency response that is depressed through the entire middle range. The sound has too much bass and treble, exaggerated depth, and a laid-back, lifeless quality. Compare "forward."

- dissonant: Unpleasant to the ear; ugly-sounding. Dissonance is an imperfection only when the music is not supposed to sound dissonant. Compare "consonant."

- dynamic: Giving an impression of wide dynamic range; punchy. This is related to system speed as well as to volume contrast.

- dynamic range:
    1) Pertaining to a signal: the ratio between the loudest and the quietest passages. 
    2) Pertaining to a component: the ratio between its no-signal noise and the loudest peak it will pass without distortion.

- extreme highs: The range of audible frequencies above 10kHz.

## F

- far field: Pertains to that range of listening distances in which the predominant sounds reaching the ears are reflections from room boundaries.

- fast: Giving an impression of extremely rapid reaction time, which allows a reproducing system to "keep up with" the signal fed to it. (A "fast woofer" would seem to be an oxymoron, but this usage refers to a woofer tuning that does not boom, make the music sound "slow," obscure musical phrasing, or lead to "one-note bass.") Similar to "taut," but referring to the entire audio-frequency range instead of just the bass.

- fat: The sonic effect of a moderate exaggeration of the mid- and upper-bass ranges. Excessively "warm."

- flanging: See "comb filtering."

- frequency range: A range of frequencies stated without level limits: ie, "The upper bass covers the frequency range 80-160Hz."

- frequency (or amplitude) response:
    1) A range of frequencies stated with level limits: ie, "The woofer's response was 20-160Hz ±3dB." 
    2) The uniformity with which a system or individual component sounds as if it reproduces the range of audible frequencies. Equal input levels at all frequencies should be reproduced by a system with subjectively equal output.

- fuzz, fuzziness: A coarse but soft-edged texturing of reproduced sound. Like "hash," but with muffled-sounding spikes.

## G

- gestalt response: The evocation of a complete memory recognition by an incomplete set of sensory cues. A gestalt response to the few things an audio system does outstandingly well can make imperfect reproduction seem more realistic than it actually is.

- glassy: Very bright.

- golden: A euphonic coloration characterized by roundness, richness, sweetness, and liquidity.
