# Gender FAQ

If you are seeing this, it means that I have *finally* come out to you ( hooray! ) or you have stumbled onto my webpage. Either way, please feel free to browse 
the common questions I get asked about my transition.

- **When did you know?**
I don't have an exact date as I was questioning for many years, but I think some time in 2023. Wishing to be magically turned into a girl when blowing out my birthday candles probably
should have been a sign though.

- **What should you call me?**
I have not chosen a new name yet, so you can continue to call me Jarrett ( any name suggestions would be helpful, please email them <a href="mailto:website.spacemail.ca">here</a> ).

- **What pronouns should I use?**
I very much prefer they / them; however, I will accept any pronouns ( subject to change in the future ).

- **Are you going to take horomones / HRT?**
Yes. Actually I have been on hormones since August. You may have noticed that I have been generally happier and healthier.

- **Do you want "the surgeries"?**
I don't know. I barely know what I want for dinner. Maybe in the future after much deliberation but for now, no.

- **What does this mean for our relationship?**
Well, hopefully nothing. I am still the same person that I have always been; I am just changing my outside to fit the inside me better. 

- **Is some of the language about trans and cis people confusing?**
Here is a small glossary of common terms provided by the Ontario government:
